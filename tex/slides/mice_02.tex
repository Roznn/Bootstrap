\begin{exampleblock}{Stantard error of the difference $d=\overline{x}_{Treat}-\overline{x}_{Cont}$}
$\overline{x}_{Treat}$ and $\overline{x}_{Cont}$ are independent, so the standard error of their difference is $\hat{\mathrm{se}}(d)=\sqrt{\hat{\mathrm{se}}_{Treat}^2 +\hat{\mathrm{se}}_{Cont}^2 }=28.93$. 
We see that:
$$
\frac{d}{\hat{\mathrm{se}}(d)}
=\frac{30.63}{28.93}=1.05
 $$
This shows that this is an insignificant result as it could easily have arised by chance (i.e. if the test was reproduced, it is \textit{likely possible} to measure datasets giving $d=0$!).  

Therefore, we can not conclude with certainty that the treatment improves the survival of the mice.
