\frametitle{Limit of the bootstrap}

\begin{block}{}
In some non conventional configurations, bootstrap might fail. For
example
\begin{itemize}
\item Incomplete data (survival data, missing data).
\item Dependent data (e.g. variance of a correlated time series).
\item Dirty data (outliers)
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\frametitle{Bootstrap for Bias correction }


\begin{itemize}
\item The bootstrap was first introduced as a method for evaluating standard errors of estimators. However, it can be easily adapted to estimate the bias of an esstimator. As a consequence, it can be used in bias correction procedure.  
\end{itemize}
